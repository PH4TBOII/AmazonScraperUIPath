	<h1>Amazon Example Scraper</h1>

	<p>
		Leaving the input blank will result in the robot using a default value of 50. Set the value to 0 to scrape all items.
		Amazon's page lists 10's of thousands of items, however, will only allow the user to scroll through 400 pages. This means the full scrape
		will have 9600 items. The robot will output the scraped data to output.tsv on the user's desktop. Because of the way amazon's page loads
		I had to add a 2 second wait for each page, which means the full scrape can take more than 20 minutes to run.
